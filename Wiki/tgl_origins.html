<p class="section-header">THE ORIGINS OF TGL</p>

<p>
	<b>A Long Story...</b>
</p>

<p>
	TL;DR: I am literally obsessed with tile-based graphics and 8-bit systems so I decided to create 
	a game engine that would attempt to replicate that same look and feel.
</p>

<p>
	I have always loved the 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color" target="_blank">Nintendo GameBoy Color</a> 
	handheld. But sadly, I've never owned one. 
	I remember when I was a kid I used to pester my parents again and again to buy me one but 
	they either couldn't afford it or they just didn't think I needed it, since I already had 
	a Super NES at home. So I basically grew up just seeing screenshots of GBC games in 
	magazines.
</p>

<p>
	Around the year 2000, I was about 13 years old and I found a gaming mag that had some 
	reviews and screenshots of 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Link%27s_Awakening" target="_blank">
	The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX</a>, as well as 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Oracle_of_Seasons_and_Oracle_of_Ages" target="_blank">
	The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages/Seasons</a>, and I became truly fascinated by the graphics. 
	The games looked so brightly colorful, charming and fun, so I became enchanted with the little machine 
	(and obviously with the little green man with the sword & shield that I later came to learn 
	was Link). The tile-based nature of the system seemed obvious, and for some reason I became 
	obsessed with tile graphics.
</p>

<p>
	At that time the launch of the Playstation 2 was just around the corner, but I believe that 
	by then the GBC was at the height of its popularity, even though my friends were all talking about 
	the Playstation and Nintendo 64. I remember being jealous the only one time that I saw a GBC in 
	person, at school. A friend showed it to me, if I recall correctly it was the translucent model 
	(like the one in the picture on the left), and he was playing 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red,_Blue,_and_Yellow" target="_blank"> 
	Pokémon Yellow, or Red, or Blue</a>, or some other early Pokémon game. I held it, and 
	he warned me to be careful not to mess with the game as he feared that I could accidentally 
	delete his save data or something, lol... So I didn't have time to enjoy and appreciate it, 
	I don't even remember playing it, I think I just held it and looked at the screen, then he 
	quickly grabbed it back. 
</p>

<p>
	As a teenager I also had an early 8-bit computer system from the 1980's called 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX" target="_blank">MSX</a> that once 
	belonged to my father, like the one in the picture below. I used to play a lot of games on it, 
	and they were mostly tile-based, just like the GameBoy. The MSX has a BASIC programming language 
	interpreter built into it, so I quickly learned how to create simple programs and games on it, 
	as my passion for tile-based graphics grew stronger.
</p>

<p>
	Later on, as an adult, I bought an old Windows PC and learned Java and C++. Computer 
	programming is my greatest passion, so it's no wonder that I soon started working in the 
	software industry as a developer, though I would constantly develop my own personal software 
	projects at home, just for the fun of it.
</p>

<p>
	At some point during my career, I found the <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank">SDL</a> 
	library, which allowed me to easily draw tiles and make simple games in C++, so I began trying 
	to create some kind of library that could encapsulate some of the beauty and charm of tile-based 
	systems that I love so much.
</p>
<p>
	A decade later, after countless iterations of countless abandoned projects, I finally came up 
	with a brand new library project from scratch where the user could easily draw 8x8 tiles, 
	play square-wave sounds using metacommands (aka Music Macro Language), read keyboard and mouse 
	input, detect collisions and all the other bells and whistles of a (very simplified) game engine. 
	It was from this project that TileGameLib, aka TGL, came to be and became my "pet" project.
</p>
<p>
	More recently, I came across other projects that more or less incorporated some of the aesthetic 
	that I wanted to achieve, specifically the <a href="https://github.com/le-doux/bitsy" target="_blank">Bitsy</a> 
	game engine and the <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php" target="_blank">PICO-8</a> 
	fantasy console, which both greatly inspired me to continue developing TGL as I realized there 
	is actually a "niche market" for this kind of thing (apparently I'm not the only tile lover in 
	the world, lol).
</p>
<p>
	And this is where it all began. :)
