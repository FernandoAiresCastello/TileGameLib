# THINGS TO DO

**GRAPHICS:**

- Improve rendering performance
- Implement stable frame rate
- Implement loading of tiles and tilesets from external files

**SOUND:**

- Implement loading and playback of audio from external files
- Improve square-wave sound synthesis
- Change sound synthesis to be able to generate the same kinds of sounds 
that the GameBoy Color is capable of.

**INPUT:**

- Implement gamepad/controller input handling

**DATA:**

- Implement datafiles, probably using ZIP methods, to allow grouping all game 
data files into a single file for release. An example of this is what the 
Allegro library does: [https://liballeg.org/stabledocs/en/datafile.html](https://liballeg.org/stabledocs/en/datafile.html)
