# TileGameLib - Side Projects
The projects contained here are also part of the TileGameLib toolkit, but are otherwise completely independent of the main project. These side projects are mostly experimental and are not intended to be used in real projects.

- [TGL.lib (C)](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameLib/tree/master/Side%20projects/TGL.lib%20(C)) is a plain C library built on top of SDL 2, compiled with GCC (MinGW-x64).

- [TileGameLibJS](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameToolkit/tree/master/Side%20projects/TileGameLibJS) is a web-based version of TGL using vanilla Javascript that offers some functionality similar to TGL.lib.

- [Unity TileGameLib](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameLib/tree/master/Side%20projects/UnityTileGameLib) contains a collection of C# scripts for use in the Unity game engine (2D mode only) that offer some functionality similar to TGL.lib.

- [TGL TilePaint](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameLib/tree/master/Side%20projects/TGLTilePaint) is a standalone C# desktop app for drawing 8x8 or 16x16 tiles in the TGL format.

- [TileGameLibCS](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameLib/tree/master/Side%20projects/TileGameLibCS) is a standalone C# desktop application (TileGameMaker.exe) built on top of Windows Forms targeting the .NET Framework. The solution also includes a dynamic library (TileGameLib.dll) that is independent from the TileGameMaker.exe application and can be used in other projects. Mostly useful for drawing and prototyping games, sort of like an IDE.

- [JTGL](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameLib/tree/master/Side%20projects/JTGL) is an attempt of a Java-based version of TGL.
