# Tile Game Toolkit
A collection of software libraries and tools for quick and easy development of tile-based, pseudo-8-bit games in C++ or C#.

Disclaimer: This toolkit is under continuous development, therefore breaking changes in the public APIs may be introduced at any time without prior notice. Use at your own risk.

**Projects included:**

- [TGL (TileGameLib)](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameToolkit/tree/master/TileGameLibC) is a C++ static library (TGL.lib) built on top of SDL2.

- [Tile Game Maker](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameToolkit/tree/master/TileGameLibCS) is a standalone C# desktop application (TileGameMaker.exe) built on top of Windows Forms targeting the .NET Framework. The solution also includes a dynamic library (TileGameLib.dll) that is independent from the TileGameMaker.exe application and can be used in other projects.

Note: There is no compatibility or interoperability between the C++ and C# projects.
