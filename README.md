# TileGameLib
TileGameLib is a toolkit for quick and easy development of tile-based, pseudo-8-bit games.

**Current version:**

**Projects:**

- [TGL.lib](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameLib/tree/master/TGL.lib) - This is the main project, a static C++ library built on top of [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org/).
- [Side projects](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameLib/tree/master/Side%20projects) - Collection of various other experimental projects and prototypes.

**Downloads:**

**Notes:**

This repository was created in 2019 and contains a collection of many distinct projects. The goal of this toolkit is to make it easy and quick to develop 2D games that look and feel like *GameBoy Color* games and other 8-bit tile-based computer systems, mainly by providing a unified and straightforward API with all the basic necessities such as tile graphics, text, sounds, music, keyboard, mouse and controller (gamepad) input, simple collision detection, string manipulation, random number generation, filesystem access, timers and debugging utilities.

Currently, the main project in this toolkit is the C++ static library [TGL.lib](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameLib/tree/master/TGL.lib), which is built on top of [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org/). In the [Side projects](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameLib/tree/master/Side%20projects) subdirectory there are various other independent and mostly experimental projects in various stages of development.

Note that everything here is currently in a "pre-alpha" stage and is under constant development. Breaking changes in the public APIs may be (and often are) introduced at any time without prior notice.

I (Fernando) am currently the sole developer. This toolkit is my hobby project and I usually work on it whenever I have some spare time. For more information, please check out the documentation or ask me directly. All questions, suggestions and bug reports are welcome. Thanks for stopping by! ‚ù§
