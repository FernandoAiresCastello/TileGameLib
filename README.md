# TileGameLib
TileGameLib is a toolkit for quick and easy development of tile-based, pseudo-8-bit games.

This repository was created in 2019 and contains a collection of many distinct projects. The goal of this toolkit is to facilitate the development of games that somewhat resemble the look and feel of *GameBoy Color* games and other 8-bit tile-based computer systems, providing a simplified and minimalistic API, while requiring few dependencies on external libraries.

Currently, the main project in the toolkit is the C++ static library [TGL.lib](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameLib/tree/master/TGL.lib), which is built on top of [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org/). In the "Side projects" subdirectory there are various other independent and mostly experimental projects. Only Windows (7/8/10/11) is currently supported.

I (Fernando) am currently the sole developer. This toolkit is my hobby project and I usually work on it whenever I have some spare time. For more information, please check out the wiki (links below). All questions, suggestions and bug reports are welcome. Thanks for stopping by! ‚ù§
