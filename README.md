# Tile Game Maker
#### Library and tools for tile-based game creation
This is a Visual Studio solution comprised of two independent C# projects targeting the .NET Framework v4.6.1 and above.

- **TileGameLib** (TGL for short) is a library project that generates a .NET DLL file, which can be used in other projects. It contains several classes designed to aid in the creation of tile-based games.

- **TileGameMaker** is a Windows desktop application project that generates a .NET executable file. It contains several tools to aid in the creation of tile-based games, built using the TileGameLib.

This project is a spiritual successor of [TBRGPT](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TBRLGPT).
