# TileGameLib
TileGameLib is a toolkit containing a pair of software libraries (one for C++, another for C#) for quick and easy development of tile-based, pseudo-8-bit games.

## About ##

In this repository there are currently two distinct, unrelated and independent "flavors" of TileGameLib: one is written in and designed for C++ programs, the other is written in and designed for C# programs. They are not compatible in any way with one another. Windows 10 and 11 are currently the only supported/tested systems.

 - **TileGameLib for C++** 
	 - Version 0.1 requires SDL 2.
	 - Version 0.2 requires SDL 3.

 - **TileGameLib for C#** 
	 - Version 0.1 requires .NET 9 and Windows Forms.

## Goals ##

The goal of this toolkit is to make it quick and easy to develop 2D games that look and feel like *GameBoy Color* games and other early 8-bit computers and game systems that had tile-based displays, mainly by providing a unified and straightforward API with all the basic necessities such as tile graphics, text, sounds, music, keyboard, mouse and controller (gamepad) input, simple collision detection, string manipulation, random number generation, filesystem access, timers and debugging utilities.

## Disclaimer ##

All projects in this repository are currently in alpha stage and under constant development. Bugs and breaking changes in public APIs may be (and often are) introduced at any time without prior notice. Use at your own risk!
