**About**

The goal of this toolkit is to make it easy and quick to develop 2D games that look and feel like *GameBoy Color* games and other 8-bit tile-based computer systems, mainly by providing a unified and straightforward API with all the basic necessities such as tile graphics, text, sounds, music, keyboard, mouse and controller (gamepad) input, simple collision detection, string manipulation, random number generation, filesystem access, timers and debugging utilities.

Note that everything here is currently in a "pre-alpha" stage and is under constant development. Breaking changes in the public APIs may be (and often are) introduced at any time without prior notice.
